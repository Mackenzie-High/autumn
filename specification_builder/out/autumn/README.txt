Folder Hierarchy:

. dot: contains Graphviz ".dot" text files and the resulting image files.

. example_builder: contains an Autumn program used to generate the specification. 

. examples: contains the Autumn example programs inside of sub-folders.
  Each sub-folder has a name of the form E####. 
  Each sub-folder is an Autumn project folder. 
  The projects can be executed using the aforesaid example_builder program. 
  Each sub-folder contains a "stdout.txt" file. 
  When the example is executed, the output is placed into that file. 

. images: contains non-Graphviz related images needed for the website. 

. markdown: contains parts of the Autumn specification written in Markdown. 
  These files will be converted to HTML by the Specification Builder (see below). 
  The HTML versions of the Markdown files will be written to the "out" folder. 

. other: is a general place to dump stuff that must be hosted on the server. 

. out: contains the output generated by the Specification Builder (see below). 
  This folder contains both HTML and JSON files. 
  These files are not viewed directly by users. 
  Instead, these files are stored on the server. 
  The users will view these files using special viewer pages.

  The special viewer pages are:

  . . ConstructPage.html                   --> This page is used to view descriptions of Autumn language constructs.
                                               The descriptions are stored as JSON files in the "out" folder. 
                                               The JSON files are generated by the Specifiation Builder. 
  . . FunctionIndexPage.html               --> This page is used to view the list of special Autumn functions. 
                                               The index is a soted in JSON file "out/index-of-functions.json". 
  . . FunctionPage.html                    --> This page is used to view descriptions of Autumn special functions. 
                                               The descriptions are stored as JSON files in the "out/functions" folder. 
                                               The JSON files are generated by the Specifiation Builder. 
  . . index.html                           --> This page is the landing page of the Autumn specification. 
                                               The index is stored in JSON file "index.json".
                                               The JSON file is generated by the Specification Builder. 
  . . TextPage.html                        --> This page is used to view parts of the specification written in Markdown.
                                               The Markdown is stored in the "markdown" folder (see above).
                                               The markdown files will be converted to HTML by the Specification Builder.
                                               The html versions of the files will be written to the "out" folder (see above).
  . . TypeCheckingExamplePage.html         --> This page is used to view the examples of type checking in Autumn. 
                                               Each example is stored in a JSON file. 
                                               The JSON files are stored in the "out/typechecks" folder. 
                                               The files generated by the Specification Builder. 
  . . TypeCheckingExamplesIndexPage.html   --> This page is used to view the list of type checking examples. 
                                               The index is stored in JSON file "index-of-type-checking-examples.json". 
                                               The file is generated by the Specifiation Builder. 

. specification: is a the Specification Builder.
  The folder is actually a NetBeans project.
  The Specification Builder depends on the Autumn compiler project. 

  The Specification Builder is a Java program that DOES the following:
  . . Convert the Markdown files in  "markdown" to HTML files in "out". 
  . . Create JSON files in "out" for Autumn Language construct.
  . . Create JSON files in "out/typechecks" for each eaxample of type checking in Autumn. 
  . . Create JSON files in "out/functions" for each example of special functions in Autumn. 

  The Specifiation Builder DOES NOT do the following:
  . . The program does not run the examples. 
  . . The program does not run Graphviz. 
  . . The program does not upload anything to Github. 
  . . The program does not upload anything to Github.
