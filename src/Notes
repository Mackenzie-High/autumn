Notes:
. Allow auto downcast in assignment via special syntax, due to the lack of generics.
. Allow loading of class files and resource files by class Autumn.
. Should the methods in the Module interface be renamed?
. The util framework will be added in a later release version.
. Class names that start with AutumnSynthetic are reserved for the compiler.
. Variables cannot be used before they are declared.
. I decided not to add autogeneration of equals and hashcode,
  because creating those methods is simplier in autumn anyway and the autogeneration
  introduces too much of complexity.

TODO:
. Should the AST printer handle string-literals better?
. Remember to check that newlines are handled correctly on Windows, etc.
. Should Parsing Failed errors be reported using ErrorReport objects?
. Fix class datum syntax. The datum should always be in parentheses.
. Make sure that yield-statements cannot be used in recursive functions.
. Should ConstructList use identity equals?
. Should AST nodes use identity equals.
. Improve ConstructList.
. What happens, if no module directive is given.
. Finish the command-line processor.
. Can val statements be used inside of a loop? If so, what happens?
