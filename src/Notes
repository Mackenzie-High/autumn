Notes:
. Should the methods in the Module interface be renamed?
. The util framework will be added in a later release version.
. Class names that start with AutumnSynthetic are reserved for the compiler.
. Variables cannot be used before they are declared.
. I decided not to add autogeneration of equals and hashcode,
  because creating those methods is simplier in autumn anyway and the autogeneration
  introduces too much of complexity.


Plan:
. Release #1:
. . Basic constructs completed - most statements & operators & datums & most expressions
. . Functions
. . Exception Definitions
. . Annotation Definitions
. . Annotations
. . Enum Definitions
. . Mutable Abstract Syntax Tree
. Release #2:
. . Tuple Definitions
. Release #3:
. . Design Definitions
. . Setter & Getter & Method Statements
. . Create Expressions
. Release #4:
. . Dispatch Expressions
. Release #5
. . Standard Library
. Release #6
. . Debugger
. Release #7
. . Documentation



TODO:
. Remember to check that newlines are handled correctly on Windows, etc.
. Should Parsing Failed errors be reported using ErrorReport objects?
. Fix class datum syntax. The datum should always be in parentheses.
. An identifier should never actually conflict with a keyword.
. Add a "wraps" clause to create expressions.
. Remove "apply". Make it a predefined function instead.
. Make sure that yield-statements cannot be used in recursive functions.
. Should ConstructList use identity equals?
. Should AST nodes use identity equals.
. Improve ConstructList.
. What happens, if no module directive is given.
. Remove the include-directives. ????u
. Remove the use-directives.
. Finish the command-line processor.
. Can val statements be used inside of a loop? If so, what happens?
. Did I confuse reference-types with declared-types?
  This may be a source of many bugs.
  For example, an array-type is a reference-type, but not a declared-type.
  What happens when casting to an array?
  What happens with instanceof on an array-type?
  Etc.
. What happens when a yield statement is placed inside of a foreach loop?
. Printer When Statements


TODO Add:
. switch statement?
. doc comments

What is Done:
. Code Generation Of:
. . Enums, excluding annotations
. . If-Elif-Else
. . While
. . Until
. . Do-While
. . Do-Until
. . Var
. . Val
. . Let
. . Nop
. . Expression Statements
. . Sequence Statements
. . Assert
. . Unary Operators: -, !
. . Binary Operators: /, %, *, +, -, .., ===, !==, ==, !=, <=, >=, <, >, &, |, ^, &&, ||
. . List Expressions
. . Field Setters and Getters
. . Call Static
. . Call Non-Static



Priority:
. Type Testing Framework
. Ternary Conditional
. Null Coalescing
. Break
. Continue
. Redo
. Is
. Method Try-Catch
. Annotations and Annotation Lists, etc
. Exception Definitions
. Annotation Definitions
. Rework Class Datum as Class Expression
. Look for problems in the grammar caused by fully-qualified names.
. Yield
. Dispatch
. Delegate
. Funcall
. Setter
. Getter
. Method
. Type Checking
. Auto Boxing and Unboxing. This will require careful study of where it is needed.
. Imports - Add the rest of the predefined imports. - Example: String = java.lang.String
. Line Number Info
