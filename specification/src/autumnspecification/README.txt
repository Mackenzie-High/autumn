As you know, the Autumn project has a related website on GitHub.
The website is the location of the language specification.
This program is what creates that website.
Using this program greatly simplifies the creation of the website.
This program allows us to automatically generate a lot of documentation.
Likewise, this program makes the creation of the html much simpler.
This program requires access to the Autumn project folder in order to operate.

This program outputs a group of JSON files, which need to be uploaded to GitHub.
These JSON files are then used by the website's Javascript to generate the html pages.
